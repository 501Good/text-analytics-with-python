# Text Analytics with Python - 2nd Edition
### A Practitioner's Guide to Natural Language Processing

Text analytics can be a bit overwhelming and frustrating at times
with the unstructured and noisy nature of textual data and the 
vast amount of information available. 
"Text Analytics with Python" is a book packed with 674 pages of useful information 
based on techniques, algorithms, experiences and various lessons learnt over time 
in analyzing text data. This repository contains datasets and code used in this book.
I will also be adding various notebooks and bonus content here from time to time. 
Keep watching this space!

Leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python and learn how to set up your own robust environment for performing text analytics. This second edition has gone through a major revamp and introduces several significant changes and new topics based on the recent trends in NLP. 

You’ll see how to use the latest state-of-the-art frameworks in NLP, coupled with machine learning and deep learning models for supervised sentiment analysis powered by Python to solve actual case studies. Start by reviewing Python for NLP fundamentals on strings and text data and move on to engineering representation methods for text data, including both traditional statistical models and newer deep learning-based embedding models. Improved techniques and new methods around parsing and processing text are discussed as well.   
Text summarization and topic models have been overhauled so the book showcases how to build, tune, and interpret topic models in the context of an interest dataset on NIPS conference papers. Additionally, the book covers text similarity techniques with a real-world example of movie recommenders, along with sentiment analysis using supervised and unsupervised techniques. There is also a chapter dedicated to semantic analysis where you’ll see how to build your own named entity recognition (NER) system from scratch. While the overall structure of the book remains the same, the entire code base, modules, and chapters has been updated to the latest Python 3.x release.

This book:
 - Provides complete coverage of the major concepts and 
 techniques of natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics
 - Includes practical real-world examples of techniques for implementation, 
  such as building a text classification system to categorize news articles, 
  analyzing app or game reviews using topic modeling and text summarization, 
  and clustering popular movie synopses and analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews
 - Shows implementations based on Python and several popular open source libraries 
 in NLP and text analytics, such as the natural language toolkit (`nltk`), 
 `gensim`, `scikit-learn`, `spaCy` and `Pattern`
